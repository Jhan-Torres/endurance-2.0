## Notes for Users

**Important**: Users with existing data stored under the old storage keys will need to:

2. Re-enter their data in the rebranded application
3. The storage keys changed from `secure_manager_*` to `endurance_*`

This ensures a clean separation between the old and new branding while maintaining the same high-quality functionality and security standards.
